      <p>
          Motohiko Makino is a software engineer with a natural knack for
          combining technical know-how with creative elements. He has 18
          years of demonstrated experience working with IC test chip and 
          yield modeling technology. He is well-versed in C/C++, Visual Basic,
          Perl, Ruby, and SQL. He uses his skills and creativity by playing
          a key role in providing solutions for integrating IC design,
          testing, and analysis. He is constantly expanding his knowledge
          and experience by keeping abreast of the evolving trends, techniques,
          and technologies to streamline efficiency. He is currently a part
          time student studying Full Stack Web Development. When he is not
          working on a computer, he repeatedly plays the same old 80s rock
          music pieces with his 6 strings, reads Russian novels from 19th
          century, and is skiing on mountains with his kid during winter.
